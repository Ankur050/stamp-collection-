            The purpose of this STAMP COLLECTING website is to provide general information for visitors that may be interested in collecting stamps and to provide the specialized information needs of more advanced stamp collectors and philatelists.<br>
            <br>

Postage stamps not only represent the development of letter mail systems over the last two centuries, but they also reflect the full range of history, art, and culture, from the beginnings of our global civilization.  It is my love of history, as well as my love of philately, that drove me to collect stamps (about 60 years ago) and to create this website (almost 12 years ago).<br> <br>
The focus of most of the collecting categories in this website is the classical (1840-1900) and early modern (1901 to about 1935) philately of Europe and North America.  In the beginning, I had envisioned a worldwide philatelic site, but it quickly became evident that composing and maintaining a site of that scope, for all the countries that have existed since 1840, was far beyond the capabilities of a single person. <br>

After almost 12 years of development and about 965 content pages, the website Collecting Categories section includes just about every stamp-issuing country in Europe and North America.  In the very near future, I will hopefully be able to begin revising and improving the text content of some of the older categories and be able to start adding new Information and Collecting page content to the existing website categories.  Some new categories could be added eventually as well.<br>

Please check back often, to see if new text content has been added.  The take-out box below is also updated regularly.  It features news about recent website status, additions, and changes.<br>
In writing content for the various stamp Collecting Categories, I have had to do quite a bit of research.  Google search and Wikipedia have become my best friends during this effort!<br> 

In searching many philatelic websites for information, I have found it very frustrating that all I seem to locate are retail websites that are primarily interested in selling stamps or philatelic products.  Many of the websites containing educational or technical information about stamp collecting require the visitor to register and provide personal information, which can eventually wind-up in the hands of commercial email, commercial letter mail, or telemarketing advertisers.  In some cases, these philatelic websites even require the payment of a subscription fee, which could place the casual visitor's financial information at-risk!<br>

It would seem that restricting the access to important information for visitors with a casual interest in stamp collecting would tend to frustrate them and to drive them away from the hobby, rather than to attract them to the hobby.<br>
