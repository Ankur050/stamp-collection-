If the visitor wishes to send lengthy communications or image files, please let me know via the form below, and I will send you an email address with which to forward your correspondence or attachments. 

Having images, either scans or photographs, is a great help in my being able to assist you with your questions.  Without an image, I can only guess at what you are probably trying to say ....

You can be assured that your information will be kept confidential, and that it will never be shared with anyone.

If you submit any stamp collecting questions that may be beneficial to other website visitors, the correspondence may be used in the appropriate FAQ page for that subject.  Your contribution will be kept anonymous, unless you request to have it attributed to you.

If you should submit any appropriate subject content that may be used in one of the website category pages, your contribution will be kept anonymous, unless you request to have it attributed to you.

I attempt to answer all stamp collecting correspondence within a few days of receipt, depending on communication traffic and my personal schedule.  Some questions are easier to answer than others are.  If your problem requires research, the effort may take a bit longer.

Occasional delays do happen, and I wish to apologize in advance for such occurrences.<p>

        ***--Important Notices--***
<p>

My website provider furnishes all the licenses and site optimization tools that I need.   Email offers for such products and services from other firms are NOT NEEDED, and those emails will be DELETED.

This website DOES NOT BUY, SELL, OR APPRAISE stamps or stamp collections, and I do not usually respond to contact form emails with such requests.  The Selling Stamps category in the Information section of the button-bar contains information about selling your stamps and external links to stamp buyers that will assist the visitor that is interested in selling their collections.

Any "sales" that originate from this website are either from affiliated advertisers, such as Google, or through external links to other affiliated commercial websites, such as eBay, Michel, or JustAnswer.com.  On the very rare occasion that I do have stamps to sell or auction, I use my eBay account for that purpose.

Thank you,
